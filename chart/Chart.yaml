  bbctl as a helm chart for partial automated management of Big Bang.

  ## Introduction

  `bbctl` is a command line interface (CLI) tool to simplify development, deployment, auditing, and maintaining the deployment of Big Bang a kubernetes cluster.

  This repository is for the `bbctl` chart. For `bbctl` application, development please refer to: https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/apps/developer-tools/bbctl.

  ## Developer Documentation

  Help Contribute! See the [developer documentation](/docs/developer.md). The CLI tool is developed in Go language and uses the [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/) library to implement commands.

  ## `bbctl` Usage and Design Priorities

  ### Multiple execution contexts

  `bbctl` will be running as a cronjob in cluster, possibly as web server in cluster, potentially in pipelines, and on developer machines.

  ### External _and_ internal users

  `bbctl` is currently used both inside and outside the Big Bang team as a fully open source project.
