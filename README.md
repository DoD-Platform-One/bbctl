## `bbctl` Usage and Design Priorities

### Automated usage over interactive usage

`bbctl` is primarily intended to be piped to/from other tools and shell scripts. Interactive use is a future possibility.

### Multiple execution contexts

`bbctl` will be running as a cronjob in cluster, possibly as web server in cluster, potentially in pipelines, and on developer machines.

### External _and_ internal users

`bbctl` is currently used both inside and outside the Big Bang team as a fully open source project.
